This project is named 'Blog Post.' I used React.js for the front end and PostgreSQL for the database. I created models, services, controllers, and routes for handling various functionalities, using Express.js as the backend framework for defining routes. On the front end, I utilized the Axios library to make API calls for creating, updating, retrieving all posts, and deleting posts."
